Comprehensive digital design verification projects using system verilog and UVM

1. ðŸŽ¯ FIFO Verification using SystemVerilog Assertions
Lightweight verification of a FIFO design using SystemVerilog assertions to validate behavior and protocol correctness.

# ðŸ”§ Features
Uses SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) for property checking

Includes a simple testbench with directed and random stimulus

Fast, simulation-ready and reusable structure

2. ðŸ”¹ FIFO Verification using UVM
Complete UVM-based verification environment for a FIFO module with constrained-random testing and coverage collection.

# ðŸ”§ Features
Full Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) testbench

Includes sequencer, driver, monitor, scoreboard, and coverage

Supports constrained-random and directed tests

Scalable and reusable environment for verifying FIFO or similar designs
